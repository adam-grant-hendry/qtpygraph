    **Detailed Description**

    A splash screen is a widget that is usually displayed when an application is
    being started. Splash screens are often used for applications that have long
    start up times (e.g. database or networking applications that take time to
    establish connections) to provide the user with feedback that the
    application is loading.

    The splash screen appears in the center of the screen. It may be useful to
    add the **Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint**  to the splash widget's window flags if
    you want to keep it above all the other windows on the desktop.

    Some X11 window managers do not support the "stays on top" flag. A solution
    is to set up a timer that periodically calls **raise** () on the splash
    screen to simulate the "stays on top" effect.

    The most common usage is to show a splash screen before the main widget is
    displayed on the screen. This is illustrated in the following code snippet
    in which a splash screen is displayed and some initialization tasks are
    performed before the application's main window is shown:

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
            **QApplication**  app(argc,
    argv);
            **QPixmap**  pixmap(":/splash.png");
    **QSplashScreen**  splash(pixmap);
            splash.show();
    app.processEvents();
            ...
            **QMainWindow**  window;
    window.show();
            splash.finish(&window);
            return app.exec();
    }

    The user can hide the splash screen by clicking on it with the mouse. Since
    the splash screen is typically displayed before the event loop has started
    running, it is necessary to periodically call
    **QCoreApplication::processEvents** () to receive the mouse clicks.

    It is sometimes useful to update the splash screen with messages, for
    example, announcing connections established or modules loaded as the
    application starts up:

    **QPixmap**  pixmap(":/splash.png");
        **QSplashScreen**  *splash = new
    **QSplashScreen** (pixmap);
        splash->show();

        ... // Loading some
    items
        splash->showMessage("Loaded modules");
    **QCoreApplication** ::processEvents();

        ... // Establishing
    connections
        splash->showMessage("Established connections");
    **QCoreApplication** ::processEvents();

    QSplashScreen supports this with the **showMessage** () function. If you
    wish to do your own drawing you can get a pointer to the pixmap used in the
    splash screen with **pixmap** (). Alternatively, you can subclass
    QSplashScreen and reimplement **drawContents** ().

    In case of having multiple screens, it is also possible to show the splash
    screen on a different screen than the primary one. For example:

    **QScreen**  *screen = **QGuiApplication** ::screens().at(1);
    **QPixmap**  pixmap(":/splash.png");
        **QSplashScreen**  splash(screen,
    pixmap);
        splash.show();
