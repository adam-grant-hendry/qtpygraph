    **Detailed Description**

    The QWebChannel fills the gap between C++ applications and HTML/JavaScript
    applications. By publishing a **QObject**  derived object to a QWebChannel
    and using the **qwebchannel.js**  on the HTML side, one can transparently
    access properties and public slots and methods of the **QObject** . No
    manual message passing and serialization of data is required, property
    updates and signal emission on the C++ side get automatically transmitted to
    the potentially remotely running HTML clients. On the client side, a
    JavaScript object will be created for any published C++ **QObject** . It
    mirrors the C++ object's API and thus is intuitively useable.

    The C++ QWebChannel API makes it possible to talk to any HTML client, which
    could run on a local or even remote machine. The only limitation is that the
    HTML client supports the JavaScript features used by `qwebchannel.js`. As
    such, one can interact with basically any modern HTML browser or standalone
    JavaScript runtime, such as node.js.

    There also exists a declarative **WebChannel API** .

        Constructs the QWebChannel object with the given **parent**.

        Note that a QWebChannel is only fully operational once you connect it to
        a **QWebChannelAbstractTransport** . The HTML clients also need to be
        setup appropriately using [`qwebchannel.js`** .

        The transport object then handles the communication between the C++
        application and a remote HTML client.

        Registers a single object to the **QWebChannel** .
