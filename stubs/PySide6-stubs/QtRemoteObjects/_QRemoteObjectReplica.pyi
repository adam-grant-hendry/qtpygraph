    **Detailed Description**

    A Remote Object Replica is a **QObject**  proxy for another **QObject**
    (called the **Source**  object). Once initialized, a replica can be
    considered a "latent copy" of the **Source**  object. That is, every change
    to a **Q_PROPERTY**  on the **Source** , or signal emitted by the **Source**
    will be updated/emitted by all **Replica**  objects. Latency is introduced
    by process scheduling by any OSes involved and network communication
    latency. As long as the replica has been initialized and the communication
    is not disrupted, receipt and order of changes is guaranteed.

    The **isInitialized**  and **state**  properties (and corresponding
    **initialized** ()/**stateChanged** () signals) allow the state of a
    **Replica**  to be determined.

    While Qt Remote Objects (QtRO) handles the initialization and
    synchronization of **Replica**  objects, there are numerous steps happening
    behind the scenes which can fail and that aren't encountered in single
    process Qt applications. See **Troubleshooting**  for advice on how to
    handle such issues when using a remote objects network.

        This signal is emitted once the replica is initialized and all property
        change notifications have been emitted.

        It is sometimes useful to respond to property changes as events. For
        example, you might want to display a user notification when a certain
        property change occurs. However, this user notification would then also
        be triggered when a replica first became `QRemoteObjectReplica::Valid`,
        as all property change signals are emitted at that time. This isn't
        always desirable, and `notified` allows the developer to distinguish
        between these two cases.
