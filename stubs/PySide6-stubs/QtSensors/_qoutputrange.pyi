class qoutputrange:
    """
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qoutputrange.html

    **Detailed Description**

    The class is defined as a simple struct.

    struct qoutputrange
         {
             **qreal**  maximum;
             **qreal**
    minimum;
             **qreal**  accuracy;
         };

    Each output range specifies a minimum and maximum value as well as an
    accuracy value. The accuracy value represents the resolution of the sensor.
    It is the smallest change the sensor can detect and is expressed using the
    same units as the minimum and maximum.

    Sensors must often trade off range for accuracy. To allow the user to
    determine which of these are more important the sensor may offer several
    output ranges. One output range may have reduced minimum and maximum values
    and increased sensitivity. Another output range may have higher minimum and
    maximum values with reduced sensitivity. Note that higher sensitivities will
    be represented by smaller accuracy values.

    An example of this tradeoff can be seen by examining the LIS302DL
    accelerometer. It has only 256 possible values to report with. These values
    are scaled so that they can represent either -2G to +2G (with an accuracy
    value of 0.015G) or -8G to +8G (with an accuracy value of 0.06G).
