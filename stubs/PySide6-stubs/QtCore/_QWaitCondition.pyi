class QWaitCondition:
    """
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qwaitcondition.html

    **Detailed Description**

    QWaitCondition allows a thread to tell other threads that some sort of
    condition has been met. One or many threads can block waiting for a
    QWaitCondition to set a condition with **wakeOne** () or **wakeAll** (). Use
    **wakeOne** () to wake one randomly selected thread or **wakeAll** () to
    wake them all.

    For example, let's suppose that we have three tasks that should be performed
    whenever the user presses a key. Each task could be split into a thread,
    each of which would have a **run** () body like this:

    forever {
            mutex.lock();
            keyPressed.wait(&mutex);
    do_something();
            mutex.unlock();
        }

    Here, the `keyPressed` variable is a global variable of type QWaitCondition.

    A fourth thread would read key presses and wake the other three threads up
    every time it receives one, like this:

    forever {
            getchar();
            keyPressed.wakeAll();
        }

    The order in which the three threads are woken up is undefined. Also, if
    some of the threads are still in `do_something()` when the key is pressed,
    they won't be woken up (since they're not waiting on the condition variable)
    and so the task will not be performed for that key press. This issue can be
    solved using a counter and a **QMutex**  to guard it. For example, here's
    the new code for the worker threads:

    forever {
            mutex.lock();
            keyPressed.wait(&mutex);
    ++count;
            mutex.unlock();

            do_something();
    mutex.lock();
            --count;
            mutex.unlock();
        }

    Here's the code for the fourth thread:

    forever {
            getchar();

            mutex.lock();
            // Sleep
    until there are no busy worker threads
            while (count > 0) {
    mutex.unlock();
                sleep(1);
                mutex.lock();
            }
    keyPressed.wakeAll();
            mutex.unlock();
        }

    The mutex is necessary because the results of two threads attempting to
    change the value of the same variable simultaneously are unpredictable.

    Wait conditions are a powerful thread synchronization primitive. The **Wait
    Conditions Example**  example shows how to use QWaitCondition as an
    alternative to **QSemaphore**  for controlling access to a circular buffer
    shared by a producer thread and a consumer thread.

    Conditions Example** .

        Releases the **lockedMutex** and waits on the wait condition. The
        **lockedMutex** must be initially locked by the calling thread. If
        **lockedMutex** is not in a locked state, the behavior is undefined. If
