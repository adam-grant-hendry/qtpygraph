    **Detailed Description**

    The QCollatorSortKey class is always created by **QCollator::sortKey** ()
    and is used for fast strings collation, for example when collating many
    strings.

    **See also** **QCollator** , **QCollator::sortKey** (), and **compare** ().

        **int QCollatorSortKey::compare(const QCollatorSortKey & otherKey )

        Compares this key to **otherKey** , which must have been created by the
        same **QCollator** 's sortKey() as this key. The comparison is performed
        in accordance with that **QCollator** 's sort order.

        Returns a negative value if this key sorts before **otherKey** , 0 if
        the two keys are equal or a positive value if this key sorts after
        **otherKey**.
