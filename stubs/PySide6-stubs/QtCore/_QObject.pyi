class QObject:
    """
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qobject.html

    **Detailed Description**

    QObject is the heart of the Qt **Object Model** . The central feature in
    this model is a very powerful mechanism for seamless object communication
    called **signals and slots** . You can connect a signal to a slot with
    **connect** () and destroy the connection with **disconnect** (). To avoid
    never ending notification loops you can temporarily block signals with
    **blockSignals** (). The protected functions **connectNotify** () and
    **disconnectNotify** () make it possible to track connections.

    QObjects organize themselves in **object trees** . When you create a QObject
    with another object as parent, the object will automatically add itself to
    the parent's **children** () list. The parent takes ownership of the object;
    i.e., it will automatically delete its children in its destructor. You can
    look for an object by name and optionally type using **findChild** () or
    **findChildren** ().

    Every object has an **objectName** () and its class name can be found via
    the corresponding **metaObject** () (see **QMetaObject::className** ()). You
    can determine whether the object's class inherits another class in the
    QObject inheritance hierarchy by using the **inherits** () function.

    When an object is deleted, it emits a **destroyed** () signal. You can catch
    this signal to avoid dangling references to QObjects.

    QObjects can receive events through **event** () and filter the events of
    other objects. See **installEventFilter** () and **eventFilter** () for
    details. A convenience handler, **childEvent** (), can be reimplemented to
    catch child events.

    Last but not least, QObject provides the basic timer support in Qt; see
    **QTimer**  for high-level support for timers.

    Notice that the **Q_OBJECT**  macro is mandatory for any object that
    implements signals, slots or properties. You also need to run the **Meta
    Object Compiler**  on the source file. We strongly recommend the use of this
    macro in all subclasses of QObject regardless of whether or not they
    actually use signals, slots and properties, since failure to do so may lead
    certain functions to exhibit strange behavior.

    All Qt widgets inherit QObject. The convenience function **isWidgetType** ()
    returns whether an object is actually a widget. It is much faster than
    **qobject_cast** <**QWidget**  *>( **obj** ) or **obj** ->**inherits**
    ("**QWidget** ").

    Some QObject functions, e.g. **children** (), return a **QObjectList** .
    **QObjectList**  is a typedef for **QList** <QObject *>.

    **Thread Affinity**

    A QObject instance is said to have a **thread affinity** , or that it
    **lives** in a certain thread. When a QObject receives a **queued signal**
    or a **posted event** , the slot or event handler will run in the thread
    that the object lives in.

    **Note:** If a QObject has no thread affinity (that is, if **thread** ()
    returns zero), or if it lives in a thread that has no running event loop,
    then it cannot receive queued signals or posted events.

    By default, a QObject lives in the thread in which it is created. An
    object's thread affinity can be queried using **thread** () and changed
    using **moveToThread** ().

    All QObjects must live in the same thread as their parent. Consequently:

    * **setParent** () will fail if the two QObjects involved live in different
    threads.
      * When a QObject is moved to another thread, all its children
    will be automatically moved too.
      * **moveToThread** () will fail if the
    QObject has a parent.
      * If QObjects are created within **QThread::run**
    (), they cannot become children of the **QThread**  object because the
    **QThread**  does not live in the thread that calls **QThread::run** ().

    **Note:** A QObject's member variables **do not** automatically become its
    children. The parent-child relationship must be set by either passing a
    pointer to the child's **constructor** , or by calling **setParent** ().
    Without this step, the object's member variables will remain in the old
    thread when **moveToThread** () is called.

    **No Copy Constructor or Assignment Operator**

    QObject has neither a copy constructor nor an assignment operator. This is
    by design. Actually, they are declared, but in a `private` section with the
    macro **Q_DISABLE_COPY** (). In fact, all Qt classes derived from QObject
    (direct or indirect) use this macro to declare their copy constructor and
    assignment operator to be private. The reasoning is found in the discussion
    on **Identity vs Value**  on the Qt **Object Model**  page.

    The main consequence is that you should use pointers to QObject (or to your
    QObject subclass) where you might otherwise be tempted to use your QObject
    subclass as a value. For example, without a copy constructor, you can't use
    a subclass of QObject as the value to be stored in one of the container
    classes. You must store pointers.

    **Auto-Connection**

    Qt's meta-object system provides a mechanism to automatically connect
    signals and slots between QObject subclasses and their children. As long as
    objects are defined with suitable object names, and slots follow a simple
    naming convention, this connection can be performed at run-time by the
    **QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName** () function.

    **uic**  generates code that invokes this function to enable auto-connection
    to be performed between widgets on forms created with **Qt Designer**. More
    information about using auto-connection with **Qt Designer** is given in the
    **Using a Designer UI File in Your Application**  section of the **Qt
    Designer** manual.

    **Dynamic Properties**

    From Qt 4.2, dynamic properties can be added to and removed from QObject
    instances at run-time. Dynamic properties do not need to be declared at
    compile-time, yet they provide the same advantages as static properties and
    are manipulated using the same API - using **property** () to read them and
    **setProperty** () to write them.

    From Qt 4.3, dynamic properties are supported by **Qt Designer** , and both
    standard Qt widgets and user-created forms can be given dynamic properties.

    **Internationalization (I18n)**

    All QObject subclasses support Qt's translation features, making it possible
    to translate an application's user interface into different languages.

    To make user-visible text translatable, it must be wrapped in calls to the
    **tr** () function. This is explained in detail in the **Writing Source Code
    for Translation**  document.

        **[invokable] QObject::QObject(QObject * parent = nullptr)**

        Constructs an object with parent object **parent**.

        The parent of an object may be viewed as the object's owner. For
        instance, a **dialog box**  is the parent of the **OK** and **Cancel**
        buttons it contains.

        The destructor of a parent object destroys all child objects.

        Setting **parent** to `nullptr` constructs an object with no parent. If
        the object is a widget, it will become a top-level window.

        The return value is the previous value of **signalsBlocked** ().

        Note that the **destroyed** () signal will be emitted even if the

        **[virtual protected] void QObject::childEvent(QChildEvent * event )**

        This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive child
        events. The event is passed in the **event** parameter.

        **QEvent::ChildAdded**  and **QEvent::ChildRemoved**  events are sent to
        objects when children are added or removed. In both cases you can only
        rely on the child being a **QObject** , or if **isWidgetType** ()
        returns `true`, a **QWidget** . (This is because, in the **ChildAdded**
        case, the child is not yet fully constructed, and in the
        **ChildRemoved**  case it might have been destructed already).

        **QEvent::ChildPolished**  events are sent to widgets when children are
        polished, or when polished children are added. If you receive a child
        polished event, the child's construction is usually completed. However,
        this is not guaranteed, and multiple polish events may be delivered
        during the execution of a widget's constructor.

        For every child widget, you receive one **ChildAdded**  event, zero or
        more **ChildPolished**  events, and one **ChildRemoved**  event.

        The **ChildPolished**  event is omitted if a child is removed
        immediately after it is added. If a child is polished several times
        during construction and destruction, you may receive several child
        polished events for the same child, each time with a different virtual
        table.

        The first child added is the **first**  object in the list and the last
        child added is the **last**  object in the list, i.e. new children are
        appended at the end.

        Note that the list order changes when **QWidget**  children are
        **raised**  or **lowered** . A widget that is raised becomes the last
        object in the list, and a widget that is lowered becomes the first
        object in the list.

        sender , const char * signal , const QObject * receiver , const char *
        method , Qt::ConnectionType type = Qt::AutoConnection)**

        Creates a connection of the given **type** from the **signal** in the
        **sender** object to the **method** in the **receiver** object. Returns
        a handle to the connection that can be used to disconnect it later.

        You must use the `SIGNAL()` and `SLOT()` macros when specifying the
        **signal** and the **method** , for example:

        **QLabel**  *label = new **QLabel** ;
            **QScrollBar**  *scrollBar =
        new **QScrollBar** ;
            **QObject** ::connect(scrollBar,
        SIGNAL(valueChanged(int)),
                             label,
        SLOT(setNum(int)));

        This example ensures that the label always displays the current scroll
        bar value. Note that the signal and slots parameters must not contain
        any variable names, only the type. E.g. the following would not work and
        return false:

        // WRONG
            **QObject** ::connect(scrollBar, SIGNAL(valueChanged(int
        value)),
                             label, SLOT(setNum(int value)));

        A signal can also be connected to another signal:

        class MyWidget : public **QWidget**
            {
                Q_OBJECT
        public:
                MyWidget();

            signals:
                void
        buttonClicked();

            private:
                **QPushButton**  *myButton;
        };

            MyWidget::MyWidget()
            {
                myButton = new
        **QPushButton** (this);
                connect(myButton, SIGNAL(clicked()),
        this, SIGNAL(buttonClicked()));
            }

        In this example, the `MyWidget` constructor relays a signal from a
        private member variable, and makes it available under a name that
        relates to `MyWidget`.

        A signal can be connected to many slots and signals. Many signals can be
        connected to one slot.

        If a signal is connected to several slots, the slots are activated in
        the same order in which the connections were made, when the signal is
        emitted.

        The function returns a **QMetaObject::Connection**  that represents a
        handle to a connection if it successfully connects the signal to the
        slot. The connection handle will be invalid if it cannot create the
        connection, for example, if **QObject**  is unable to verify the
        existence of either **signal** or **method** , or if their signatures
        aren't compatible. You can check if the handle is valid by casting it to
        a bool.

        By default, a signal is emitted for every connection you make; two
        signals are emitted for duplicate connections. You can break all of
        these connections with a single **disconnect** () call. If you pass the
        **Qt::UniqueConnection**  **type** , the connection will only be made if
        it is not a duplicate. If there is already a duplicate (exact same
        signal to the exact same slot on the same objects), the connection will
        fail and connect will return an invalid **QMetaObject::Connection** .

        **Note:** Qt::UniqueConnections do not work for lambdas, non-member
        functions and functors; they only apply to connecting to member
        functions.

        The optional **type** parameter describes the type of connection to
        establish. In particular, it determines whether a particular signal is
        delivered to a slot immediately or queued for delivery at a later time.
        If the signal is queued, the parameters must be of types that are known
        to Qt's meta-object system, because Qt needs to copy the arguments to
        store them in an event behind the scenes. If you try to use a queued
        connection and get the error message

        **QObject** ::connect: Cannot queue arguments of type 'MyType'
            (Make
        sure 'MyType' is registered using **qRegisterMetaType** ().)

        call **qRegisterMetaType** () to register the data type before you
        establish the connection.

        The object will be deleted when control returns to the event loop. If
        the event loop is not running when this function is called (e.g.
        deleteLater() is called on an object before **QCoreApplication::exec**

        an object that lives in a thread with no running event loop, the object
        will be destroyed when the thread finishes.

        Note that entering and leaving a new event loop (e.g., by opening a
        modal dialog) will **not** perform the deferred deletion; for the object
        to be deleted, the control must return to the event loop from which
        deleteLater() was called. This does not apply to objects deleted while a
        previous, nested event loop was still running: the Qt event loop will
        delete those objects as soon as the new nested event loop starts.

        first deferred deletion event is delivered, any pending events for the
        object are removed from the event queue.

        otherwise returns `false`.

        A signal-slot connection is removed when either of the objects involved
        are destroyed.

        disconnect() is typically used in three ways, as the following examples
        demonstrate.

        1. Disconnect everything connected to an object's signals:
        disconnect(myObject, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);

        equivalent to the non-
        static overloaded function


                myObject->disconnect();

          2.
        Disconnect everything connected to a specific signal:
        disconnect(myObject, SIGNAL(mySignal()), nullptr, nullptr);

        equivalent
        to the non-static overloaded function
        myObject->disconnect(SIGNAL(mySignal()));

          3. Disconnect a specific
        receiver:

                disconnect(myObject, nullptr, myReceiver,
        nullptr);

        equivalent to the non-static overloaded function
        myObject->disconnect(myReceiver);

        `nullptr` may be used as a wildcard, meaning "any signal", "any
        receiving object", or "any slot in the receiving object", respectively.

        The **sender** may never be `nullptr`. (You cannot disconnect signals
        from more than one object in a single call.)

        If **signal** is `nullptr`, it disconnects **receiver** and **method**
        from any signal. If not, only the specified signal is disconnected.

        If **receiver** is `nullptr`, it disconnects anything connected to
        **signal**. If not, slots in objects other than **receiver** are not
        disconnected.

        If **method** is `nullptr`, it disconnects anything that is connected to
        **receiver**. If not, only slots named **method** will be disconnected,
        and all other slots are left alone. The **method** must be `nullptr` if
        **receiver** is left out, so you cannot disconnect a specifically-named
        slot on all objects.

        **Note:** Disconnecting all signal-slot connections will also disconnect
        the **QObject::destroyed** () signal if it is connected. Doing so can
        adversely affect classes that rely on this signal for cleaning up
        resources. It is recommended to disconnect only the specific signals

        classes.
          2. **method** is not a member of receiver class or one of its

          3. **signal** instance represents not a signal.

        QMetaMethod() may be used as wildcard in the meaning "any signal" or

        Some events, such as **QEvent::ShortcutOverride**  must be explicitly
        accepted (by calling **accept** () on them) in order to prevent
        propagation.

        **Warning:** If you delete the receiver object in this function, be sure
        to return true. Otherwise, Qt will forward the event to the deleted
        object and the program might crash.

        **void QObject::installEventFilter(QObject * filterObj )**

        Installs an event filter **filterObj** on this object. For example:

        monitoredObj->installEventFilter(filterObj);

        An event filter is an object that receives all events that are sent to
        this object. The filter can either stop the event or forward it to this
        object. The event filter **filterObj** receives events via its
        **eventFilter** () function. The **eventFilter** () function must return
        true if the event should be filtered, (i.e. stopped); otherwise it must
        return false.

        If multiple event filters are installed on a single object, the filter
        that was installed last is activated first.

        Here's a `KeyPressEater` class that eats the key presses of its
        monitored objects:

        class KeyPressEater : public **QObject**
            {
                Q_OBJECT
        ...

            protected:
                bool eventFilter(**QObject**  *obj,
        **QEvent**  *event) override;
            };

            bool
        KeyPressEater::eventFilter(**QObject**  *obj, **QEvent**  *event)
            {
        if (event->type() == **QEvent** ::KeyPress) {
                    **QKeyEvent**
        *keyEvent = static_cast<**QKeyEvent**  \\*>(event);
        **qDebug** ("Ate key press %d", keyEvent->key());
                    return
        true;
                } else {
                    // standard event processing
        return **QObject** ::eventFilter(obj, event);
                }
            }

        And here's how to install it on two widgets:

        KeyPressEater *keyPressEater = new KeyPressEater(this);
        **QPushButton**  *pushButton = new **QPushButton** (this);
        **QListView**  *listView = new **QListView** (this);
        pushButton->installEventFilter(keyPressEater);
        listView->installEventFilter(keyPressEater);

        The **QShortcut**  class, for example, uses this technique to intercept
        shortcut key presses.

        **Warning:** If you delete the receiver object in your **eventFilter**
        () function, be sure to return true. If you return false, Qt sends the
        event to the deleted object and the program will crash.

        Note that the filtering object must be in the same thread as this
        object. If **filterObj** is in a different thread, this function does
        nothing. If either **filterObj** or this object are moved to a different
        thread after calling this function, the event filter will not be called
        until both objects have the same thread affinity again (it is **not**
        removed).

        A meta-object contains information about a class that inherits

        Changes the thread affinity for this object and its children. The object
        cannot be moved if it has a parent. Event processing will continue in
        the **targetThread**.

        To move an object to the main thread, use **QApplication::instance** ()

        **QApplication::thread** () to retrieve the thread in which the

        If **targetThread** is `nullptr`, all event processing for this object
        and its children stops, as they are no longer associated with any
        thread.

        Note that all active timers for the object will be reset. The timers are
        first stopped in the current thread and restarted (with the same
        interval) in the **targetThread**. As a result, constantly moving an
        object between threads can postpone timer events indefinitely.

        A **QEvent::ThreadChange**  event is sent to this object just before the
        thread affinity is changed. You can handle this event to perform any
        special processing. Note that any new events that are posted to this
        object will be handled in the **targetThread** , provided it is not
        `nullptr`: when it is `nullptr`, no event processing for this object or
        its children can happen, as they are no longer associated with any
        thread.

        **Warning:** This function is **not** thread-safe; the current thread
        must be same as the current thread affinity. In other words, this

        Since both slots and signals can be used as receivers for signals, and
        the same connections can be made many times, the number of receivers is
        the same as the number of connections made from this signal.

        When calling this function, you can use the `SIGNAL()` macro to pass a
        specific signal:

        if (receivers(SIGNAL(valueChanged(**QByteArray** ))) > 0) {
        **QByteArray**  data;
                get_the_value(&data);       // expensive

        **Warning:** This function violates the object-oriented principle of
        modularity. However, it might be useful when you need to perform
        expensive initialization only if something is connected to a signal.

        Returns a pointer to the object that sent the signal, if called in a
        slot activated by a signal; otherwise it returns `nullptr`. The pointer
        is valid only during the execution of the slot that calls this function

        The pointer returned by this function becomes invalid if the sender is

        (). If called outside of a slot activated by a signal, -1 is returned.

        For signals with default parameters, this function will always return
        the index with all parameters, regardless of which was used with
        **connect** (). For example, the signal `destroyed(QObject *obj =

        parameter), but this function will always return the index with a
        parameter. This does not apply when overloading signals with different
        parameters.

        Starts a timer and returns a timer identifier, or returns zero if it
        could not start a timer.

        A timer event will occur every **interval** milliseconds until
        **killTimer** () is called. If **interval** is 0, then the timer event
        occurs once every time there are no more window system events to
        process.

        The virtual **timerEvent** () function is called with the
        **QTimerEvent**  event parameter class when a timer event occurs.
        Reimplement this function to get timer events.

        If multiple timers are running, the **QTimerEvent::timerId** () can be
        used to find out which timer was activated.

        Example:

        class MyObject : public **QObject**
            {
                Q_OBJECT
        public:
                MyObject(**QObject**  *parent = nullptr);

                startTimer(milliseconds(50));
        startTimer(seconds(1));
                startTimer(minutes(1));

                //
        since C++14 we can use std::chrono::duration literals, e.g.:
        startTimer(100ms);
                startTimer(5s);

            {
                **qDebug** () << "Timer ID:" << event->timerId();
        }

        Note that **QTimer** 's accuracy depends on the underlying operating
        system and hardware. The **timerType** argument allows you to customize
        the accuracy of the timer. See **Qt::TimerType**  for information on the
        different timer types. Most platforms support an accuracy of 20
        milliseconds; some provide more. If Qt is unable to deliver the
        requested number of timer events, it will silently discard some.

        The **QTimer**  class provides a high-level programming interface with
        single-shot timers and timer signals instead of events. There is also a
        **QBasicTimer**  class that is more lightweight than **QTimer**  and
        less clumsy than using timer IDs directly.
